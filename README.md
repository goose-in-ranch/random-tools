# random-tools
Here I upload random tools to help my personal workflow for fun

These (Currently) two tools were written as a spur of the moment thing to automate some
tasks I commonly performed manually. Another reason I wrote these was to get some
programming practice. I am open to criticism and would love to hear how I could improve
this code to make it easier to read and more efficient! :)
